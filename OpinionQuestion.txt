What is your stance on exception handing in backend applications, and how do you typically implement it in your C# projects?

Exception handing is crucial part of any application and it plays vital role for backend applications in managing the errors without crashing the application and offer meaningful feedback. It enhances the reliability of the application by preventing unhandled exceptions, which can lead to application failure or sometimes dataloss. It also helps in user interaction by providing informative error messages instead of a lengthy stack trace informations during errors. Also this will enable logging mechanism to properly track errors and these logs are very crucial especially when troubleshooting issues in live environment. Proper exception handing helps developers to pinpoint and isolate sections of code that are prone to errors. This exception handing of displaying friendly messages also provides security by not exposing our internal code or stack trace to the outside world.

I implement exception handling in critical code sections for examples in the ToDOAPI, I have implemented at controller level where any failure in the API can be tracked and traced at that point. And I generally use log handlers for writing the exceptions mostly log4net to record exceptions. In few scenarios based on the business logical flow I can go for few custom exceptions as well, this generally provide more helpful information in identifying in which flow this issue has been arised. In the .net core applications I will use the exception filters where this approach gives me a flexibility to handle exceptions in centralized manner.
